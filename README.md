# Movie-Recommender-System
The Movie Recommender Project is a Python-based system designed to provide movie recommendations based on user input and ratings. Leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, the recommender system suggests movies that share similarity with user-searched titles and align with the user's historical preferences.
